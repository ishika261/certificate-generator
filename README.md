# certificate-generator
A simple script to "automate-certificate" generation.

Used PILLOW or PIL image processing library to automate the tedious task of certifcate generations ans openCV to dynamically get the co-ordinates as the starting point of the text.

The task is basically 3 steps:
1. Select the Co-ordinates via trail and error
2. Get the data ready
3. Load the required fonts and template in the right format
3. Experiment with PILLOW to get the desired results.
4. Run the script to genrate all the certificates
